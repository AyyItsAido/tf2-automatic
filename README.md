**tf2-automatic** is a bot inspired by the [bptf-automatic](https://bitbucket.org/jessecar/backpack.tf-automatic) project. The bot is available under the MIT license, anyone can downloaded and modify it, though you can't run it without having access to the [TF2 Automatic API](https://api.tf2automatic.com).

Before you install the bot, there are a few things you need to have taken care off before you will be able to run the bot.

* It is highly recommended / needed to have an alt account that you can use. I suggest using the [Steam Desktop Authenticator](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) to authenticate the account, and get the secrets used to automate generating 2FA codes and managing mobile confirmations. The account can't be limited, you can check if it is limited by visiting this link while signed in to Steam as the alt: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663
* You need access to our API - go to https://tf2automatic.com/order and choose a free or premium subscription plan, or go to https://tf2automatic.com/manage to see your subscriptions if you have any
* NodeJS version 8 or more

For a walkthrough on how to set up the bot, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Nicklason/tf2-automatic/wiki). For additional help and questions, please ask in the TF2 Automatic [Discord server](https://tf2automatic.com/discord).
